This line:
Call the NextAuth() function with your authentication settings (like providers).
It gives you back some tools (handlers, signIn, signOut, and auth) that you can export and use in your app.
1.handlers
handlers is ready-made code from NextAuth.
It knows how to respond to things like:
GET /api/auth/session
POST /api/auth/signin
POST /api/auth/signout
GET /api/auth/callback/:provider
You don’t have to write the logic yourself.
Instead, you just plug it into your route.ts file.
